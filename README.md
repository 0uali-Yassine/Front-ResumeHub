## Project Overview

The **Resume Management System** is designed to allow Manager to manage resumes in an intuitive way. The frontend handles the user interface for displaying resumes, adding new resumes, and editing existing ones. The system is built with React and includes modal functionality for adding/editing resumes.

This frontend communicates with the backend (not included here !! yet!!) to fetch, add, update, and delete resume data.
